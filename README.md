## Project Title: Voyage Line City Transit Report

### Overview
The **Voyage Line City Transit Report** is an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard developed to analyze ridership patterns across a cityâ€™s bus transit system. The dashboard provides data-driven insights to help city transit authorities manage operations effectively, optimize bus utilization, and understand peak performance hours.

The dashboard leverages historical ridership data, trip schedules, and bus routes to produce actionable insights for management decision-making. The primary goals of this dashboard include understanding rider distribution, identifying peak operational times, and analyzing bus utilization to improve overall efficiency.

### Key Features:

1. **Total Riders (Passengers)**:  
   Displays the total number of passengers using the transit system.

2. **Total Buses**:  
   Displays the total number of buses operating on the transit routes.

3. **Trip Time Trend**:  
   Visual representation of passenger ridership trends during different times of the day.

4. **Peak and Down Hours of Operation**:  
   Identifies the peak hour and the down hour of operation based on passenger ridership to help manage operational resources.

5. **Time Range Distribution**:  
   Shows the distribution of rides based on specific time slots in the day, making it easier to spot high-demand periods.

6. **Route Performance**:
   - **Busiest Route**: Highlights the busiest route, indicating where the majority of passengers travel.
   - **Least Busy Route**: Displays the least traveled route to help optimize service schedules.

7. **Year-over-Year Change**:  
   Displays a percentage change in ridership compared to the previous year.

8. **Monthly and Weekday Distribution of Riders**:  
   Breaks down ridership by months and days of the week to detect seasonality and daily patterns.

9. **Bus Utilization**:  
   Categorizes buses into three utilization groups: Property Utilized, Overutilized, and Underutilized, helping to ensure the right allocation of resources.
